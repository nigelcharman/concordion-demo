# Compound Annual Interest

The formula for compound annual interest is CI = P (1 + R/100) ^ n

For further details see [this article](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php)

## Example:

If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually, 
the value of the investment after 10 years can be calculated as follows...

P = 5000. r = 5/100 = 0.05 (decimal). n = 10.

If we plug those figures into the formula, we get:

A = 5000 (1 + 0.05 / 12) ^ 12(10) = 8235.05.

So, the investment balance after 10 years is $8,235.05.
